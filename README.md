## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hey, I'm Case - a developer who spends far too much time making things nobody really asked for.  
I started out building scripts and mods for FiveM, and now Iâ€™m slowly dragging my Lua brain into the indie dev world.  

Most of what youâ€™ll find here are small projects, experiments, and questionable ideas that seemed fun at 3 AM.

## â˜• Fun Fact
The code isnâ€™t bad. Itâ€™s just misunderstood.
